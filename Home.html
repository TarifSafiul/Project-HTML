    <h3>Islamic University is ranked as one of the top public universities in Bangladesh as well as the largest seat of higher education in the south-western part of the country. Situated 24 kilometers south of Kushtia and 22 kilometers north of Jhenidah district-town in a lush green countryside, the university is by-passed by Khulna-Kushtia National Highway which provides its lifeline of connectivity with the rest of the country. The passing of the Islamic University Act in 1980 conferred this institution the permanent prestige of being the first university established after the independence of Bangladesh, reflecting the hopes and aspirations of the new nation striving to be on par with other international players through the promotion of science, business, humanities, and interfaith dialogue.

By now, Islamic university has been exceptionally renowned as the major international center for theological, general, applied science, technology and engineering studies. The university addresses the needs of both the local and foreign students, facilitating them with a broad spectrum of undergraduate studies and postgraduate research and teaching. In this way, the university seeks to promote understanding of the rich cultural diversity of humankind in order to prepare students to go forth with skills, knowledge and wisdom to serve and advance the communities in which they live and work. Islamic University is eager to gain a foothold in Asia and also aims to transform itself into a world class university (WCU). The vision is to become a globally recognized university.
